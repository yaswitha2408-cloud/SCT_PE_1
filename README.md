Writing Better Prompts

This project is part of my Prompt Engineering learning journey.
The focus is on Task 01: Writing Better Prompts – understanding how small changes in prompt wording can significantly affect AI responses.

🔍 Objectives

Learn the basics of prompt engineering

Experiment with clarity, specificity, and tone

Rewrite vague prompts into improved versions

Compare AI outputs before and after refinement

📝 Examples

1. Internet

Vague: “Tell me about the internet.”

Improved: “Explain how the internet works in 4 bullet points, as if teaching a 10-year-old.”

2. Artificial Intelligence

Vague: “Write about AI.”

Improved: “Write a short paragraph (5–6 lines) explaining what Artificial Intelligence is, with one real-life example.”

3. World War II

Vague: “Explain World War II.”

Improved: “Summarize the key causes and outcomes of World War II in 5 bullet points for a high school student.”
