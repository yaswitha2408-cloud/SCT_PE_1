Photosynthesis Explained

Definition:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight to make their own food. They convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into glucose (sugar) and oxygen (O₂).

CO₂ – taken from the air

H₂O – absorbed from soil

C₆H₁₂O₆ – glucose, the plant’s food

O₂ – released into the air

Where it Happens:

In the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain chlorophyll (the green pigment).

Steps (Simplified):

Light Absorption: Chlorophyll captures sunlight.

Water Splitting: Sunlight splits water into oxygen and hydrogen.

Carbon Fixation: CO₂ combines with hydrogen to form glucose.

Oxygen Release: Oxygen is released as a byproduct.



IMPROVED OUTPUT:

Photosynthesis for Kids

What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air.

How It Works (Simple Steps):

Sunlight: Plants catch sunlight using their green leaves.

Water: Roots suck up water from the soil.

Air: Leaves take in a gas called carbon dioxide from the air.

Making Food: The plant mixes sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make sugar (food for the plant).

Oxygen: While making food, the plant also gives out oxygen for us to breathe!

Fun Way to Remember:

Sun + Water + Air → Plant Food + Oxygen

Think of the plant as a tiny chef: sunlight is the oven, water is the ingredient, and air is the spice, making yummy sugar for itself!
